# README

MovieCentral is an e-commerce store that sells movies. Conveniently enough... my favorite movies. 

Technologies used: 
	Rails – Back-end framework
	Foundation 5 – Front-end css framework
	Devise – User authentication
	Redis – Key-value store
	Braintree – Payment system

Things still left to do:
	Re-direct to main page after adding movie to cart (convenience)
	Get search bar working/styled properly (commented out)
	Change login/register font/menu style
	Add BrainTree payment system
