# README

MovieCentral is an e-commerce store that sells movies. Conveniently enough... my favorite movies. 

Technologies used: <br>
	Rails – Back-end framework<br>
	Foundation 5 – Front-end css framework<br>
	Devise – User authentication<br>
	Redis – Key-value store<br>
	Braintree – Payment system<br>

Things still left to do:<br>
	Re-direct to main page after adding movie to cart (convenience)<br>
	Get search bar working/styled properly (commented out)<br>
	Change login/register font/menu style<br>
	Add BrainTree payment system<br>
